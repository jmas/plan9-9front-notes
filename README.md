# Plan 9 / 9front notes

I want to set up and play with Plan 9 using the 9front fork. That is why I started researching how Plan 9 works and collecting useful resources and projects that I can potentially undertake to learn how Unix-like systems work. Another big motivation is to lean Go using Plan 9 / 9front.

Why Plan 9? Because it uses Unix principles but implements them in a more extreme way. I love seeing how files are used in Plan 9. The most impressive moment was when I saw that we can use `/dev/draw` to interact with graphics. The idea that everything is a file is huge.

I understand that this system cannot be called modern, but I see potential in how I can use it. For example, I imagine that interacting with an ESP32 device could be simplified to reading/writing a file over the network. It sounds cool. It takes me back to the times when I was working on FrogCMS. It’s a tiny CMS, but powerful under the hood.
